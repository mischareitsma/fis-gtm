# GT.M Tutorial

This folder contains a simple tutorial for Mumps. Each chapter is divided in
three parts:

1. `<name-of-chapter>-read.md`: Overview of the material that is covered.
1. `<name-of-chapter>-exercise.md`: Few exercises to apply the read material.
1. `<name of chapter>-solution.md`: Solutions to the exercise.

## Work notes:

- First chapter should be easier, how to start mumps, how to write stuff, add
  stuff, concatenate strings. All the usual first stuff.
- Chapter about variables should cover trees as well
