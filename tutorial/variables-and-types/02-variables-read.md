# Variables

In Mumps, there are two kind of variables:

1. Local variables only exists in memory, as long as the Mumps process is
   running.
1. Global variables are written to disk, and exists beyond the Mumps process.

In addition, in Mumps, these variables can be of two types:

1. Strings
1. Numbers

The number is precise up to 18 digits. After that, the least significant
numbers will be ignored and replaced by zero.
